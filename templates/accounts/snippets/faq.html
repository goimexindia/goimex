                                    <p> Custom clearance processes in the region - especially UAE - are highly digital
                                        and thorough. There are many government resources on this subject in different
                                        languages. All you need for clearance (if the cargo type is not regulated) are
                                        the following: a commercial invoice, packing list and airway bill (or seaway
                                        bill, depending on the shipping mode) and Certificate of Origin (COO) if the
                                        shipment is by sea. COO is not required when using air cargo. However, if the
                                        cargo type is regulated (meaning the items need further certification like in
                                        the case of Food & Beverage), a pre-certification is required from the
                                        authorities prior to shipping. To determine the nature of certification
                                        required, your transporter or Goimex Logistics Team may guide you through the
                                        process by checking the HS Codes (Harmonized Systems Codes) provided by the
                                        seller.

                                    <p>Ramadan is a Holy month observed by Muslims worldwide as the month of fasting,
                                        prayer, piety, and is considered one of the five pillars in Islam. It lasts for
                                        about 29 days followed by 3 days of holidays. Every year Ramadan starts and
                                        concludes about 10 days earlier in the calendar, for example in 2022, it
                                        start on 13 April. During Ramadan, working hours in the public and
                                        private
                                        sectors are reduced to 6 hours a day usually from 09h00 till 14h00. Workload and
                                        capacity are somewhat reduced, therefore, international sellers might experience
                                        slower than usual responses and some delays. Sellers are advised to prepare for
                                        transactions in advance.</p>

                                        <p>You should always consider insurance when transporting goods. Whether you’re
                                            using Goimex logistics or a 3rd party provider, please make sure to ask
                                            about good insurance coverage and check all the inclusions. Nonetheless,
                                            taking precautions also greatly helps reduce the risk of damage like the
                                            following:

                                            Make sure the packages are packed in strong and durable materials and
                                            covered in shrink wrap films to help avoid moisture while in transit.
                                            Its recommended photograph the cargo before handing it over to the
                                            transporter. These images can be useful later to claim insurance in case of
                                            damage or loss.
                                            Choosing a reliable transporter helps mitigate any damage risk. If your
                                            transporter suggests proper packing, then you should consider this
                                            step. </p>
